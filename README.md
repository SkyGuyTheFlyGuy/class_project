# Project Description:
I have thought about what to do for quite a long time, and
due to the nature of how badly I am struggling in this class,
an idea that I have landed on is just a program that demonstrates
different aspects of the different principles taught in this class. 
Those being Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
I genuinely feel like I still struggle with even the most basic
precepts of all of those class/object concepts that designing
a fully fledged program that has a practical use, I truly feel,
is beyond my personal capabilities. If I need to be docked
points because my program wont be, by definition, doing
anything significant, that is fine. I hope to get out of this
project, if anything,  a greater understanding of the concepts
that I still struggle to understand.
